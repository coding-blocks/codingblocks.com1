    {
      "ques": "Who should do this course?",
      "ans": "Anybody who is interested in learning C++ programming can do this course. C++ is a powerful language and is pretty easy to learn. Coding in its most essential form is nothing but problem solving. It deals with figuring out logical solutions and implementing them optimally. The process of learning to code transforms a person into an analytical thinker with strong mathematical and logical skills."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Will this course help if I have C++ in class 12th?",
      "ans": "Yes, absolutely. There is a lot more to learn in C++ than the school curriculum. School syllabus just scratches the surface of C++ programming and doesn’t cover most of the Data Structures, which will be covered in this course in great detail."
    },
    {
      "ques": "I didn’t have C++ in class 12 ? Can I do this course ?",
      "ans": "Yes. Our instructors will start the C++ course from beginner's level. You don’t need any prior programming knowledge to attend this course. What we need is dedication and passion to learn programming from your side."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Will this help me with competitive programming or can I apply to ACM-ICPC after doing this course?",
      "ans": "This course will help you become smarter with your solutions. You’ll be able to write solutions that run in lesser space and time. The last time we heard from capable competitive programmers, they said these skills made them capable."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Will this course help me in Interviews?",
      "ans": "Yes, absolutely. Our course is designed in such a way it covers from fundamentals to advanced topics. Many frequently asked Interview questions will be done in the class and in assignments. We will have special interview talks by industry experts from reputed companies."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Will I get any certification?",
      "ans": "Yes, you will get certification after you successfully pass the online exam after completing the course. For certification, we suggest joining both Level 1 and Level 2 courses."
