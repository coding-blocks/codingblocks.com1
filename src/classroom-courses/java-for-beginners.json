  "faqs": [
    {
      "ques": "Who should do this course?",
      "ans": "Anybody who is interested in learning programming can take the Java training. Java is a powerful and elegant language, but still is pretty easy to learn. Also, this opens the path to enter Enterprise Java world for making powerful desktop and web applications or mobile apps using Android."
    },
    {
      "ques": "I know C, should I do this course?",
      "ans": "Yes. Absolutely. Not only will this course teach you Java, but also Object Oriented Programming which forms the base of most, if not all code running live across the globe. Besides it builds your problem solving skills, teaches you some fine data structures and helps you develop the thinking process to optimise your solutions."
    },
    {
      "ques": "I know C++, should I do this course?",
      "ans": "Depends. Knowing C++ generally means you know Object Oriented Programming well. If that is the case, you’ll be better served by learning some courses which teach you to create making mobile apps or web applications. Please check out our Pandora and Elixir course for those."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Will this help me with competitive programming or can I apply to ACM-ICPC after doing this course?",
      "ans": "This course will help you become smarter with your solutions. You’ll be able to write solutions that run in lesser space and time. The last time we heard from capable competitive programmers, they said these skills made them capable."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Will this course help me in Interviews?",
      "ans": "Yes. If you learn well, all that the course intends to teach, you’ll be able to impress quite a few interviewers across quite a few fine companies."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Will this help me in making websites and apps?",
      "ans": "No. This is a fundamentals course. To make websites and apps, you need to learn more. Please check out our <strong>Pandora &amp; Elixir</strong> course for those."
    },
    {
      "ques": "Is this CORE Java or Advanced Java?",
      "ans": "This is not CORE java or Advanced Java. This is a course which teaches you problem solving, data structures and Object Oriented Programming. Though, most of what CORE java means is being covered. The aim of the course is to help you with a smarter beginning. For being able to make web and mobile apps you need to learn frameworks. Android is one such framework for mobile apps. Please check out our Pandora and Elixir course for more details on these lines."
