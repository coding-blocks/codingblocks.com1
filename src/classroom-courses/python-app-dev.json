The first part of the course help students to understand how python syntax works, related concepts and the latter part deals with automating mundane tasks using python. Through this course, students will be made comfortable with python for computations, object-oriented python, python standard template library, databases and web application.</p><p>This course includes multiple activities through which students will have hands-on experience of python programming. Students will be aligned with a mentor who will guide them throughout the course. This course enables students to learn data Science, Machine Learning or web development using Django in future.</p>",
