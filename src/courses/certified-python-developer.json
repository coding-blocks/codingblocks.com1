	"content": "The Certified Python Developer program is a brand new program by COding Blocks which will deal with basic web development and machine learning concepts using Python.<br/> Python is slowly but surely becoming the language of choice for developers. What a lot of people like is that you can follow an Object Oriented paradigm, butdo some functional programming as well. Python is well known to have a package for everything, and these packages are very well documented too, which helps. Other advantages with Python are easy deployment, convenient database work and straightforwad synchronization. Unlike other languages, you can just focus on the problem and implement it without having to fuss with syntax or intricate ways of making things work. So dive into this enjoyable language and make life easy for yourself.",
