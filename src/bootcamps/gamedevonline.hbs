                                    really cool bootcamp with hands-on practice of JavaScript as we built the 4 games in
                                    the class itself. We got know about the working of Physics Systems in Phaser and
                                    build some great multi-level games. </p>

                                    Blocks. We made 4 awesome games using JavaScript with phaser and HTML canvas. The
                                    things got really easy with the way Prateek bhaiya taught us. He cleared every doubt
                                    we had with ease. I never taught it is this easy to develop games. They also
                                    provided some nice notes for future reference. Overall it was the best Game Dev
                                    Using JavaScript Bootcamp one can attend.
