    },
    {
      "ques": "Will this bootcamp help if I already know JavaScript?",
      "ans": "Yes, absolutely. There is a lot more to learn in the bootcamp. You will get familiar with game concepts like game loop, HTML Canvas and Phaser.io which is something beyond the normal JS used for web development."

    {
      "ques": "Can I build my own games after this bootcamp ?",
      "ans": "This course will help you become smarter in writing codes. You’ll be able to build 2-d multilevel games involving physics on your own. Also this will take your JS skills to the next level. Learning Phaser will be a plus-point for your CV too."
